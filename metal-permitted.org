Attempt to put together all that I have previously done on metal recombination lines, particularly in Orion

* New stuff [2017-10-24 Tue]

** TODO Get line strengths vs (n, T) from Storey (2017)

** TODO Look at O I 7773 recombination line
+ From Jorge GarcÃ­a's talk
+ O I triplet at 7771 + 73 + 74 Ang
+ Supposedly a recombination line
+ I think we have it in the MUSE data
+ This is in wavelength section 5
*** DONE First impressions
CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 17:56]
+ Line clearly detected
+ Contaminated by night sky, which needs to be dealt with
+ To first order, looks like [O II] 7330
  + /Except/ it is missing some features:
    1. Narrow bright bar completely missing
    2. Orion S high-Te region is much weaker (not a surprise)
    3. HH 202 is weaker I think
*** TODO [1/5] Steps to reduce MUSE 7773 line
+ [X] Extract line
+ [ ] Extract line better (turns out there is another line at 7780, which means that we can't get a continuum level on the red side of the line)
+ [ ] Deal with night sky component
  + Needs to be done panel by panel
  + Maybe use [O I] 5577 - *no, it is too different*
  + Work from outside \to inside and look for jumps between tiles
+ [ ] Multi-binning
+ [ ] Fuzzing
  + (or is that really necessary?)
  + might be, if we want to take ratios
** TODO Looking at all the MUSE O II and N II lines
+ These are in better shape than I thought
+ We should be able to get the O II V1 multiplet in three parts:
  1) 4642+39
     - cleanly extracted
     - but blended with N III and N II
  2) 4649+51
     - very badly extracted 
     - we will need to fit gaussians I think
     - to get densities, we need to discriminate 49 from 51
  3) 4674+76
     - a bit weak, but extracted OK
     - except that it is affected by the He II 4686 absorption
     - so best to use gaussians
+ Ratio 4642/5007 shows peak along rim of Big Arc
+ N II lines
  + 4607 is badly contaminated with [Fe III]
  + 4631 is OK but noisy
  + 4803 is weak and only to W of Trap
  + 5667, 5680 are similar (*multiplet 3*)
    + (combination of several components)
    + Additional weaker ones at 5686, 5711
    + Look similar to 4642, except for inner bits
    + 5680 could maybe used to remove N II from 4642
      + Recomb coeffs are in Pequignot et al 1991
      + Around 1.4e-13 (Case B) for 5680
      + But /doesn't give/ 4642
      + Fang 2011 has them too
      + Looks like *5680/5667 is a density indicator*
        + R = 2 => 1e4 pcc
        + R = 1.5 => 1e3 pcc
        + [X] Ratio needs maps to be binned
        + I get a gradient from about 1.7 to 1.4 from center to outskirt of the nebula.  But I have to bin it an awful lot
  + 5942 is clearly different and may have fluorescent component

* Guide to all my previous work
+ Figures that I am gathering from other places are in [[file:copied-figs/]] 
** General musings
+ I have a lot of discussion in the org file [[file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/recomb-lines.org][file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/recomb-lines.org]]
  + For example [[id:DE843C1D-0502-4DB0-8C49-538DAC045AF6][Fluorescence vs recombination for the permitted lines]]
    + where I draw on some of Vladimir's papers, but don't come to any firm conclusions
    + Although I note that the 4591 line gives an ADF of zero
+ 
** Ratios that should stay the same in the V1 multiplet
+ Theoretical ratios
  + 4642 / (4639+49+51+62) = 0.32
  + 4674 / (4639+49+51+62) = 0.13
  + 4676 / (4639+49+51+62) = 0.02
+ Manu spectra [[file:copied-figs/oii-insensitive-blue.pdf]]
  + Discussed in [[file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/Manu%20Spectra.ipynb][file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/Manu Spectra.ipynb]]
  + Need to add 43% N II + N III contamination to the 4642 line 
+ Adal spectra [[file:copied-figs/oii-insensitive-adal-slit6.pdf]]
  + Discussed in [[file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/Adal%20spectra.ipynb][file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/Adal spectra.ipynb]]
  + No need for correction for N II but N III is still blended - could maybe be resolved by fitting gaussians
** Density-sensitive ratios
+ He I 5876/6678 ratio
  + Trouble is, the MUSE maps show that this is largely due to extinction
  + Varies from 2.8 (high extinction) to 3.6 (low extinction)
  + Adal has it other way up: 0.3 to 0.34, so a similar range
+ Manu has [Cl III] and [Ar IV] ratios, which may be more sensible
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-density-compare.pdf]]
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-density-vs-radius.pdf]]
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-vs-cliii-densities.pdf]]
    + Strangely, O II densities are lower than 
** Temperature-sensitive ratios
+ Adal spectra with binning has lots of plots, such as
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-t-orlcel-vs-cel-adal-bin.png]]
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-t-orl-vs-cel-adal-bin.png]]
+ Manu spectra
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-oiii-temperature-masked.pdf]]
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-oiii-temperature.pdf]]
  + [[file:copied-figs/oii-temperature-three-vs-radius.pdf]]
+ The comparison of T(ORL-CEL) with T(CEL) is consistent with a 10% difference between the two
+ The T(ORL) values from O II V1 4649 / V 15 4591 are strange
  + The ratio *falls* with radius for Manu data, which indicates that
    T is climbing!
    + Observed values \approx 10 at 30 arcsec, falling to 5 at 100 arcsec
    + Implying T rises from 3000 K to 7000 K
  + But Adal results are a /bit/ more sensible
    + There is a jump in the CEL T at the edge of Orion-S, with Orion S having a higher 4363/4959
    + It also has a lower V1/4959, consistent with higher T
    + And a lower 4649/4591 (about 6 => T = 5000 K)
    + Whereas directly below Trap has 4649/4591 = 9 => T = 4000 K
    + Equivalent T(CEL) are 8700 and 8400 K
+ *But note that these all need de-reddening*
+ Other T-sensitive ORL ratios are
  + 4649/4189
    + Looks like we can see it clearly in Manu spectra - not sure why I haven't measured it
  + 4649/4089
    + Affected by various blends
